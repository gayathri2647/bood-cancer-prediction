                    <h2>About This Project</h2>
                    <p>This Blood Cancer Prediction application is designed to assess the risk of blood cancer based on patient data including age, gender, blood test results, and symptoms. The application uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in the data and provide a result.</p>
                    <p>This tool was developed as an internship project to demonstrate the application of machine learning in healthcare diagnostics.</p>

                    <h2>How It Works</h2>
                    <p>The prediction model was trained on a dataset containing blood test results and symptoms from patients with and without blood cancer. The application uses the following machine learning models:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Logistic Regression</li>
                        <li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</li>
                        <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After evaluating all models, the best performing one was selected for this application.</p>

                    <h2>Blood Cancer Information</h2>
                    <p>Blood cancers affect the production and function of blood cells. Most blood cancers start in the bone marrow where blood is produced. Common types of blood cancer include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Leukemia:</strong> Cancer of the blood and bone marrow</li>
                        <li><strong>Lymphoma:</strong> Cancer of the lymphatic system</li>
                        <li><strong>Myeloma:</strong> Cancer of plasma cells</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Early detection of blood cancer is crucial for effective treatment. Common symptoms include fatigue, fever, night sweats, weight loss, frequent infections, easy bruising or bleeding, and bone pain.</p>
